# Orb of Legend

Sylas was on his usual hunt for food down the castle marketplace, when he stumbles upon an opening in the corridor, which has not existed before.
At the end a door showed itself, leading to the unknown. A symbol, etched on the door, the same one that was carved on the corridor wall.
Sylas, being orphaned and nothing to live for, opened the door, and well...the rest is history.
